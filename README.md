Orgstrata is an open‑source initiative designed to give organizations a live, transparent, and unified view of their entire operational landscape—Business, Applications, Data, and Technology.It acts as a singBusinessle source of truth, connecting to existing systems like ERP and CRM, while also supporting small organizations that may not have enterprise tools. With minimal data entry, Orgstrata visualizes the full organizational hierarchy:Company → Branches → Floors → Employees → Tasks → Projects → Milestones → KPIs → Goals → Cost → ROIOrgstrata empowers leaders, teams, and stakeholders to understand the present state of the organization instantly—without waiting for reports, consultants, or manual spreadsheets.

1. Organizations operate in silosBusiness, IT, HR, Finance, and Operations often use disconnected toolsData is fragmented, outdated, or manually maintainedDecisions rely on assumptions instead of real‑time insights2. Lack of transparency slows growthLeaders cannot see the true status of projects, KPIs, or ROITeams struggle to align goals with executionSmall companies lack affordable tools to manage their structure3. Traditional enterprise tools are expensive and rigidERP/CRM systems are powerful but not designed for holistic visualizationCustom dashboards require heavy development and maintenanceSMEs cannot justify the cost or complexity4. Organizations need a living digital blueprintA real‑time map of people, processes, systems, and outcomesA way to track performance, cost, and value creationA transparent environment that supports governance and accountabilityOrgstrata solves all of this by providing a unified, open, extensible platform
